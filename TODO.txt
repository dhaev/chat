future features:

That’s great! You’ve covered the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for messages. Here are a few more functionalities you could consider adding to your API:

Pagination: If there are a lot of messages, it might be useful to implement pagination to retrieve them in smaller chunks.

Search: Allow users to search their messages based on content, sender, or date.

Sort: Provide options to sort messages, for example, by date (newest or oldest first).

Read Receipts: Track whether a message has been read by the recipient.

Group Messages: If your application supports group conversations, you might need additional APIs to manage groups (add/remove participants, change group name, etc.).

Message Reactions: Allow users to react to messages (like, love, laugh, etc.).

Message Forwarding: Allow users to forward messages from one conversation to another.

Rich Media: Support for sending images, videos, and other rich media in messages.

Remember, the exact functionalities will depend on the requirements of your application. It’s always a good idea to start with the features that are most important for your users. Good luck with your project
